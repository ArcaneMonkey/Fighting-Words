YOU AINT FROM MICHIGAN IF YOU AIN'T DONE THIS BEFORE
It's [day].
Ah yes, [an] [aday]'s built for dads.
THE SPOKES OF THE WHEEL OF FATE HAVE BEEN REPLACED
EARTH IS BROKEN
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY
THE DOCTOR SAID SIX MONTHS
The Box is locked,
BORN TO DIE
THE LAZY SUSAN OF FATE IS TURNING
Cant escape from pots and pans,
FLEE FROM THE ORDERS WRITTEN IN HEAVEN
If this bout doesn't triple my heart rate I will be very cross
Reality is transforming!
CAN'T ESCAPE FROM CROSSING MICHIGAN
Money's on the table.
Crank it To 11!
THIS PARTY'S GETTIN' CRAZY!
BIENVENUE POWER BOTTOMS!
My dick is hard.
Every cell is burning!
Don't disappoint your father, put your hands up.
It's [day], my dudes!
Don't fly too close to the sun!
YOU KNOW I HAD TO DO IT TO 'EM!
The Book of Souls is missing your names.
NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH SAUCE
Revolvers drawn at high noon!
A MIDNIGHT MEAL WITH THE DEVIL
TOILET ROLL FORWARD OR BACKWARDS,
From up above and from beneath!
GODS PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE
YOU'RE CANCELED
WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD
The earth of destiny is cycling
There's nothing to eat in the fridge!
THE CARDS HAVE BEEN DEALT
Put on a show!
Blame Yourself or God.
DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS
You don't have long on this earth
OMENS APPEAR TO US
Diplomacy has failed!
SIN. DEATH. JUDGEMENT. ETERNITY.
The building blocks of vocabulary fall forward!
HE TOOK YOUR KIDS
THE DOMINOES ARE FALLING!
Welcome to Flavortown!
CAN'T ESCAPE FROM GREAT LAKES CROSSING
TWO MOTHERFUCKERS DETECTED
The Moon Shall Fall
THIS ONE GOES OUT TO THE COWS
THE WAY IS LIT
THE HYPER COWBOYS AIN'T GONNA LET YOU FORGET THIS
THE WAR BELLS RING
IF YOU DIE TONIGHT
PEOPLE THINK THEY CAUGHT YOU SLEEPIN'
Let us cut god to see if he bleeds!
When is [day]?
It’s [day], or as I like to call it:
Can you feel the storm?
Everyone rumored!
Live like a wind-rammer as you fuck!
The fight for your life was yesterday,
PEACE IS A LIE
Loser buys me a drink.
It’s a good day for a swell battle!
This match will get red hot!
A great slam and then some!
My wife left me yesterday.
You gonna let ‘em get away with that?
Don’t talk to Blanka players!
Only one of you will be remembered in the end!
The history of this world is written with fists!
When we die,
Can’t escape from crossing fate!
The wheel of fate is turning!
You may not think it be like it is, but it do!
Break their spine until their children are in pain!
The winner gets $10 and an edged orgasm.
The struggle for survival begins anew!
Losing is winning!
Punks jump up to get beat down.
Alright, folks, I want a good clean battle.
This is the end times.
Set em up and knock em down!
BEAT!
The winged serpent demands tribute.
It’s time to break the law!
THE EUPHONY OF LIFE IS FINITE
Stage Restrictions and Endless Infinite Levels are Preventing you from Escaping, Coward! 
Death comes for us all
I call dibs on the loser’s stuff.
This is what makes us feel ALIVE
A clash of wills,
Evolve or die!
Set loose the dogs of war!
He’s probably going to lose, but he’s going to try his best.
The crowd came here for a battle.
So begins the Opera of Assault,
Make it rain, baby!
Let’s party like a pubescent peasant!
The moon seeks a show,
Pick a god and pray!
All is dust,
Border of life,
Catastrophe of Heaven
Beware the Umbrella
Drive your fire!
Strawberry crisis?!
Master the principal art of cutting.
When I look at the moon I see a perfect society.
Destroy the lies of fate
This week's dish:
Four hundred years fed only on hatred
Sound and Fury
Death loves all equally
YOU ARE BLADES FORGED FOR ONE PURPOSE
There is no safety here.
RAISE YOUR SWORD AND CHALLENGE EVERYTHING
A Storm is Approaching
ARE YOU OKAY?
If it has a pulse, take its skull!
So I say. This is the law of kings
I broke free on [an] [aday] morning
You are a worm through time.
Leave your insides by the door.
A copy of a copy of a copy.
This too shall pass.
I WARNED YOU ABOUT THE STAIRS BRO!!!
Fear is the appropriate response
Rip and Tear
Expel philosophy
That is not dead which can eternal lie.
THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING
TIME FOR A GRAND SLAMWICH
THE SHOW'S ABOUT TO BEGIN
IS IT HOT IN HERE OR IS IT JUST ME?
The open road beckons...
Will you spend five minutes with Jesus?
THE GENESIS OF A NEW ERA
BRUSH YOUR TEETH THREE TIMES DAILY
CHECK YOUR STOVE
On this HOLY NIGHT
WE'RE NO STRANGERS TO LOVE
TWO MEN WALK INTO A BAR
THE BEAUTY AND THE SORROW
THE TASTE OF WAR
STRUGGLE IN A WASTED SPACE
THE TEARS OF THE INNOCENT ARE THE WINE OF THE SINNER
AS ABOVE SO BELOW
UNKNOWABLE CREATURES TICKLE YOUR FEET
The Planet Betrays You.
Nothing is sacred.
Beings without substance
Beings without souls
Strong Fighters in your Area NOW!
My husband is DEAD!
A necklace of follicles with sabertooth monocles
The nuns are burning wheels again
WONDERING WHERE THE ARBY'S WENT
My BALLS Hurt
Monkeys Are Fighting
Don't Screw This Up
Wait, don't fight!
We are a new breed.
You're a little teapot, short and stout
NOW FIGHT, wait, that's backwards
I forgot my line.
Shit, sorry, hold on.
CAN YOU FEEL THE SMELL OF THE GAME
School has just begun
It's Time To Kick Gum And Chew Ass
I PISSED THE BED
(The entire French translation of the Iliad)
Holy shit, did I leave the oven on?
Will the cycle never end?
Fight for your right to party
We are people with superpowers
It’s one of those days
The accident was 6 years ago.
When you're a celebrity they let you do it.
May you find a worthy opponent
The year is zero
Life Before Death
There are violent and disturbing images in this game
This is not a place of honor.
Women want me. Fish fear me.
Why Bother?
It's 106 miles to Chicago. We got a full tank of gas, half a pcak of cigarettes,
We're on a mission from god.
The Gloves are on!
Soul as pure as snow,
THE FLOWERS ARE BEAUTIFUL
It's 4:30 AM
THE DREGS GATHER IN YOUR SHADOWS
72 MILLION DEAD SAMURAI
FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN 

$secondline
NOW PAY THE MECHANIC,
SEND THE INVOICE TO GOD
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HER A CALL
THE CLOCK SAYS 90 SECONDS
The lights are on,
WORLD IS A FUCK
THE FASTEST SINNER WILL EDIT THE TEXT
Take a breath...!
Don't disappoint us.
THE CARBUNCLE ATE ITSELF!
Your fists are harder.
Blood pumping, heart racing!
Let's get this bread,
VARIOUS GOAT NOISES!
One of you holds the pen.
This town aint big enough!
DINE AND DASH
RANCH AND PIZZA MAKE SENSE TO HEATHENS,
THESE APPLE BOTTOM JEANS WON'T FIT THEMSELVES
Eyes and jaws, claws and Teeth!
IT'S YOUR TURN.
THERE IS NO REMISSION OF SIN
You know what that means
The cellphone of destiny is close!
CASTLE DOCTRINE
Make this a good one
God forgive us all
ARE YOU READY TO MEET GOD?
Finish the story!
YOU TOOK HIS WIFE
WHO WILL TAKE GLORY?
NINETY SECONDS OR LESS!
Fight or fuck, the choice is yours!
ONLY ONE MAY LEAVE
THE PATH IS CLEAR
ABANDON THE ILLUSIONS OF FATE
HEAVEN OR HELL
BUT THE PODCAST STILL ENDS AT 4:59
Breakfast in bed!
Fate is not a cage except to those who fear it.
If my god should fail me, I shall kill him too.
Forgive us for this violence we are about to inflict.
[day]!
This is the truth!
Breakdown!
It’s coming!
No one beleived!
There is no shame in losing.
There is much shame in losing!
This will be a match to remember!
but this still matters!
THERE IS ONLY PASSION!
My father killed himself last week
Decide fate!
We die alone!
Actually, just go crazy with it!
You better go all out!
DOWN!
RAZE THE EARTH
Ready or not, here we go!
This is what makes us strong!
Let’s make it a whole series!
Necrophantasia
Where is the heart?
Infinite darkness.
Smell the reek of destruction!
This is Bullshit Blazing!
Exhale! exult!
Royalty is a continuous cutting motion.
Wield the blade of want!
Prove your will is eternal!
Cajun-style gumbo with a little pinch of violence
ALWAYS LISTEN TO A HOT BABE
The dawn is your ENEMY
Love is under my will only
Symbolizing nothing
The secret doom is within this sermon
Bask in my glamour!
Say no elegies for the melting stone.
ATLAS OF SMOKE
Every star in the sky is holding its breath
It Cannot End Like This
BURNING!
Does any of it matter?
Money and Power Through Homicide!
If it builds a house, smash it flat!
Strength is my god
Either make it your own or learn your place.
Happiness comes later
White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye
You've always been the new you.
A copy of a copy of a copy.
This happens more and more now.
After the song, time for applause!
You must choose to be the chosen one.
HAIL THE CONQUEROR WORM!
Does fighting make you horny too?
Hope you brought your brown pants!
I TOLD YOU DOG!
IT KEEPS HAPPENING
Behold! A Man!
Until it is Done
Reverse Ideology
This is what you are
Live to forget!
The fate of sixty years
HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT
EXPECT SOME TURBULENCE
THE AUDIENCE IS IN THEIR SEATS
IT'S ABOUT TO GET TOASTY
Whose moxie matches their motor?
WHALE BURIAL
DO you have what it takes to come out on top of a no holds barred match with your lord and savior?
TIME IS APPROACHING FIGHT TILL DEATH
SECOND PLACE WINS THE KITCHENAID STAND MIXER
LAST ONE IN IS A ROTTEN EGG
HALLELUJAH, HOLY SHIT WHERE'S THE TYLENOL
IT'S ALMOST BEDTIME, PLAYER
streams int he desert
ACTS of the ALMIGHTY
YOU KNOW THE RULES AND SO DO I
GOD HAS LEFT
CHILD OF THE DARK
CONFRONT THE GOD OF YOUR FEARS
WALK ON WATER TO REACH THE FUTURE
NOW LET YOUR BLOOD AND BODY BE AS ONE
DIVINE SOLILOQUY OF MAN AND BEAST
Thick, ropey strands
UNKNOWABLE CREATURES TICKLE YOUR FEET
BETTER FIND SOME SOCKS
A Texas Funeral
Nothing is safe.
Oh shit, I'm feeling it!
I don't want love. I justy want violence
FORSAKEN, DEPRAVED AND WROUGHT WITH FEAR 
Raise your entrails as an offer
SHIT
HAKUNA MATATA
Guys, stop.
You've shown them your handle
THE STENCH MAKES THE HEAT RISE HIGHER
The Playground is yours
And I'm all out of ass!
GOD DAMN IT BILLY
There's no time to worry about that now!
I have been here before.
Any regrets?
Have you no shame?
Put it all on the line
So it's time for one of us to pull a power up from his ass
It’s time to exterminate
You have to move on.
Grab them by the HEAT OF BATTLE!
May your sins come back to torment you
Your ash will not touch the ground.
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR WRETCHED SOUL
and oh shit, some motherfucker about to touch cow tits.
Strength Before Weakness
Hateful maggots, all.
I am alone on this barren earth.
Do your parents know where you are?
Did you get your permissin slip?
You got a loicense for them fists?
Eat a dick
It's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.
This review is getting long!
Corrupted by the Eternal Swamp.
